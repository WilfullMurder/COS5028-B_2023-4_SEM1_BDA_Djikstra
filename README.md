# COS5028-B_2023-4_SEM1_BDA_Djikstra
Djikastra's algorithm based on one of the lecture problems.
For some reason the lecturer chose Travelling salesman problem to introduce binary trees? IDK man.
Anyway I wrote a quick djikstra to solve shortest path problem.
Planning on implementing a visual component when I get a chance
